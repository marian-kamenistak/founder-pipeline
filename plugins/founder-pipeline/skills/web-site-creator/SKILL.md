description: Use whenever the owner wants to build, rebuild, or ship a BRAND-NEW website, landing page, product site, marketing site, or consultant site (new repo, new domain, new deploy pipeline) — triggers on "build a site", "new website for X", "landing page for Y", "ship the site", "product site", "web for the stream". The canonical house-stack web-build pipeline; `/founder-pipeline:founder` Stage 13 routes here. NOT for adding a page or section to an ALREADY-LIVE site, NOT for decks, NOT for post-launch growth work, and NOT for auditing a site this pipeline did not build (use `/founder-pipeline:seo-audit`).

# Web Site Creator — Orchestrator

Ship a fast, SEO-ready, AI-crawlable product site (home + 3–5 pages + blog) on your declared house stack. This file routes; the work lives in `phases/`, the recipes in `references/`. **Load only the phase file you are executing.**

## The bar

Build the most impressive, interactive, scroll-stopping site you could imagine — the one a visitor screenshots and sends to a friend, never mistakable for a site-builder or AI default. The ambition holds WITHIN the gates, never against them: 95+ mobile Lighthouse is non-negotiable, every interaction keyboard-reachable, `prefers-reduced-motion` fully honored, one signature move done exceptionally beats five gimmicks. A site that clears every gate but looks like everyone else's has failed; so has a dazzling site that scores 60 on mobile. Hit both.

## Scale the effort to the change

- **Small change** (copy tweak, link reorder, text/color swap on an already-verified component): edit → `npm run build` passes → ship. NO browser screenshots, NO design-review round; `curl | grep` of built HTML if you must confirm a string rendered.
- **Substantial change** (new page, layout/structure change, new interactive component, new visual pattern): run the relevant phase file + its gate.
- Unclear which? Ask — don't default to the expensive path.
- **Worktree isolation:** before a Substantial change — or a batch of several Small changes worked in one sitting — call `EnterWorktree` (or fall back to a manual `git worktree add` flow) so the session works in its own directory instead of the shared checkout. Skip it only for a genuinely small change shipping in the same turn. Why: two sessions editing the same working directory can silently step on each other — one session's uncommitted edit sits in the same folder another session is `git add -A`ing, and the second session's commit absorbs the first session's unrelated in-flight work. Observed on a real build: a concurrent i18n session's commit swept up another session's uncommitted analytics-proxy edit plus a stray doc file.

## House stack

The house stack is **declared once** by the owner (`/founder-pipeline:founder` → P1.S1) and referenced everywhere after. Every phase file below is written against it. Any deviation needs the owner's recorded override.

**Shipped default, and the worked example this skill is written around:** Astro 5 (MDX + Content Collections) · Cloudflare Workers Static Assets · Tailwind (token-driven) · Motion One + View Transitions · Pagefind · a CAPTCHA/turnstile provider · a transactional email provider · a product-analytics tool · a newsletter tool per product.

The recipes in `references/` are stack-specific by necessity. If your declared house stack differs, the *rules* (gates, imagery floor, hero must-haves, crawler delivery, canonical host) all still apply; the *commands* need translating to your stack, and you should record the translation in the repo's `PLAYBOOK-CASE-NOTES.md` once rather than re-deriving it per build.

## Phase DAG

```
1 CORE (skeleton → content → pictures)      phases/1-core.md
   ├─ 2 VISUAL (design system, de-AI)       phases/2-visual.md   ┐ 2→3 sequential
   ├─ 3 INTERACTIVITY (effects, forms)      phases/3-interactivity.md ┘ (same files)
   └─ 4 METADATA (OG, JSON-LD, favicons)    phases/4-metadata.md  [parallel-safe]
5 SEO + AI-SEO (research, on-page, crawler delivery) phases/5-seo.md (finalizes after 4)
6 LAUNCH (final gate, deploy, indexing)      phases/6-launch.md   (analytics WIRED in 5, VERIFIED here)
→ hand off to post-launch growth (see GATE 6)
```

**Execution rules (deterministic):**
1. A phase is DONE only when its GATE block passes. Never start the next phase early — except the marked parallel lanes.
2. **Parallel lanes** — dispatch as subagents the moment inputs exist, marked `[P]` in phase files: research rounds (protocol: `phases/5-seo.md` §5.0 — round 1 at Phase 1.0, round 2 mid-build, round 3 pre-publish), image curation from the image-library catalog, translation of each finished default-locale page, Phase 4 metadata work, design reviews, the staging SEO crawl audit. Everything `[S]` runs in order in the main context — Phases 2 and 3 both touch layout/CSS and are never parallelized against each other.
   **Phase 5/6 sequence by file zone, not topic** (`phases/5-seo.md` → "Execution order"): Z1 standalone routes/`public/` (robots.txt, IndexNow, RSS, NLWeb, llms files), Z2 layout `<head>` (titles, JSON-LD, RSS link, analytics wiring — pulled forward from what used to be 6.2), Z3 page bodies (content depth THEN internal links — serial, in that order), Z4 nav/footer, Z5 new pages. Z1/Z2/Z4/Z5 run `[P]` against each other; Z3 is `[S]` internally. Four barriers gate the rest: **BARRIER 1** content freeze (`/founder-pipeline:brand-voice` + local-build checks) → **BARRIER 2** one staging deploy serving both GATE 5 and GATE 6.1 (merged verification wave: SEO crawl audit, design review, Lighthouse, axe, security scans, crawler-delivery matrix, forms, analytics) → **BARRIER 3** production deploy (6.3: reachability curl set, crawler-delivery matrix run AGAIN — this one catches edge-level failures staging can't) → **BARRIER 4** `/founder-pipeline:web-indexation`, hard-gated on Barrier 3's matrix returning all-200 (never enqueue a URL that errors for a bot).
   **Photos come from your configured image library first:** whenever a page needs a photo (hero, section, background), browse the relevant subfolder of the library path recorded in the repo's `PLAYBOOK-CASE-NOTES.md` BEFORE reusing repo assets or scraping anything. Pick by subject match to the section's topic (a mentoring section gets a mentoring shot, not a stage shot), copy the file into the project's `src/assets/`, and only fall back to other sources when no subfolder covers the subject.
3. **Screenshots and visual checks go through a headless renderer, NOT a browser-automation tool driving your own browser.** **Set an explicit mobile viewport** — pick your primary test device and record it in `PLAYBOOK-CASE-NOTES.md` so every build measures against the same numbers. Common 2025-era iPhone viewports in CSS px: 393 × 852 (base), 402 × 874 (Pro, DPR 3), 430 × 932 (Plus), 440 × 956 (Pro Max).

   Note that scraping CLIs frequently ignore viewport flags and always return a 1920×1080 desktop shot. Call the rendering API directly for anything mobile — e.g. with `/founder-pipeline:firecrawl-scrape`'s provider, reading the key from your environment:

   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRECRAWL_API_KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"url":"<URL>","waitFor":7000,
          "formats":[{"type":"screenshot","fullPage":true,
                      "viewport":{"width":393,"height":852}}]}' -o shot.json

   curl -sL "$(python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('shot.json'))['data']['screenshot'])")" -o mobile.png
   ```

   `fullPage:true` returns the whole page (393 × ~13000 on a long landing page) — crop the band you care about with `sharp(...).extract({left,top,width,height})` rather than trying to scroll. Download the signed asset URL with `curl -sL`, not a Python one-liner: some system Python builds ship without a usable CA bundle and fail with `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`.

   A headless renderer paints at a specified viewport and returns the image, so a mobile check is one call at a real 390px width. Driving your own browser instead carries three failure modes that cost real time on a live build: an occluded window paints nothing (screenshots come back blank and CSS transitions freeze at t=0, so reveals look broken when they are fine), desktop Chrome refuses to resize below ~590px so true mobile width is unreachable, and it happily serves a pre-purge cached copy right after a deploy. Use browser automation only for things a renderer genuinely cannot do: driving a form end to end, solving a CAPTCHA widget, or reading `getComputedStyle`/`getBoundingClientRect` off a live DOM.
4. **Design-review cadence (mandatory, findings get FIXED not filed):** round 1 after GATE 1 (structural), round 2 at GATE 2 (compression), round 3 at GATE 3 (full P0/P1/P2 incl. mobile). Dispatch each round as a subagent (or your own design-review skill if you have one installed) with a live URL + explicit scope + "return P0/P1/P2 findings with concrete CSS/utility-class changes". Apply every finding or record the skip reason in `PLAYBOOK-CASE-NOTES.md`, then re-verify. Any open P0 blocks publish.

## Single source of truth

| What | Lives in | Never in |
|---|---|---|
| A rule / checklist item | exactly ONE `phases/*.md` | SKILL.md, references |
| A recipe / code / war story | exactly ONE `references/*.md` | phase files |
| Site-specific facts (keywords, competitors, skips) | that repo's `PLAYBOOK-CASE-NOTES.md` | this skill |
| Post-launch growth (backlinks, listings, magnets, loops) | the post-launch skills named at GATE 6 | this skill |

New lesson → rule as one line in the right phase file + recipe in the matching reference + bump `references/CHANGELOG.md`.

## Skills cheat-sheet

Skills marked **(plugin)** ship with this plugin. Skills marked **(optional dependency)** come from a separate public plugin the user installs themselves — if it isn't installed, do the work inline and say so. Everything else is an inline instruction, because no skill ships for it.

| When | How |
|---|---|
| Every public string | `/founder-pipeline:brand-voice` (plugin, mandatory) |
| Positioning check (Phase 1.0) | `/founder-pipeline:critical` (plugin) |
| Design extraction (Phase 2.0) | `/founder-pipeline:firecrawl-scrape` (plugin) against the brand's reference URL, then hand-extract palette, type scale and spacing into `tokens.json` + `DESIGN.md` |
| Pricing page (Phase 1.2) | `/founder-pipeline:pricing` (plugin, ≥95/100 before shipping) |
| Visual ambition (Phases 2–3) | `/frontend-design:frontend-design` (optional dependency) |
| Design review ×3 | Subagent per the cadence above, or your own design-review skill |
| Rendering a page to LOOK at it (screenshots, visual/mobile checks) | `/founder-pipeline:firecrawl-scrape` (plugin) — **not** a tool driving your own browser |
| Keyword contract | `/founder-pipeline:web-keyword` (plugin) |
| Translations | Translate each finished page into the secondary locale, then run the result through `/founder-pipeline:brand-voice`; keep a `TRANSLATION-GLOSSARY.md` at repo root so terms stay stable across pages |
| SEO audit (GATE 5) | `/founder-pipeline:seo-audit` (plugin) for the on-page rules; add a third-party crawler (Screaming Frog, Sitebulb, Ahrefs Site Audit) for the crawl layer |
| `robots.txt` | Build it inline per `phases/5-seo.md` §5.2 — tiered UA blocks, then verify delivery with the crawler-delivery matrix in §5.3 |
| AI-search on-page work | `/founder-pipeline:ai-seo` (plugin); `llms.txt` quality bar: `/founder-pipeline:ai-seo-llms-builder` (plugin) |
| Analytics | `/posthog:instrument-product-analytics` (optional dependency) if you run PostHog; otherwise wire your own analytics tool's equivalent events |
| AI-visibility baseline + citation-rate tracking | Post-launch, ongoing — not a manual probe here. Record the launch-week baseline in `PLAYBOOK-CASE-NOTES.md` |
| Post-launch growth | `/founder-pipeline:web-backlinks`, `/founder-pipeline:blog-launch`, `/founder-pipeline:web-listings`, `/founder-pipeline:lead-magnets` (all plugin) |
| Paid acquisition | Out of scope here — hand off to whatever ads workflow you run |
| Adding a page/section to a site this skill already shipped | Don't re-run the whole pipeline: run only the phase that owns the change (usually 1.2 → 2 → 4 → 5 Z3) plus its gate, reusing this skill's `references/` |
| Cookie consent bar (built in Phase 3.2, verified in 6.2) | `references/launch.md` §14.5.8 — build from the recipe, don't improvise |

*v4.0 — **consent model inverted: reject-only is now the default.** Every build ships a two-button bar (Reject + Accept, no Settings panel); everyone is treated as accepted until they click Reject. `references/launch.md` §14.5.8 carries the full recipe — `consent_v1` cookie contract, the `html[data-consent]` + CSS-reveal pattern that works on a CDN-cached static site (the HTML cannot vary per visitor, and as a bonus no-JS crawlers never see the bar), pull-for-init/push-for-live-changes, and a "what breaks silently" list. Six failure modes documented because five of them ship looking correct: an analytics `opt_out_capturing()` call stops pageviews too unless the SDK's cookieless mode is set; analytics cookies are cross-subdomain so a host-only delete leaves them in place; `reset()` alone writes a fresh cookie; `pointerdown` fires before `click` so an interaction-gated loader boots at full config AFTER a Reject; guard on the SDK's own loaded flag, not on the global existing. Consent Mode v2 flipped to granted-by-default with `region` + `wait_for_update` **deleted rather than flipped** (flipping the signals but keeping `region` grants the world and denies Europe) and `security_storage` granted in both payloads. §14.5.8 states the legal divergence once and names the two constants that switch back to strict opt-in, which client/EU/Google-Ads builds still need. History: `references/CHANGELOG.md`.*

*v3.7 — this skill covers brand-new site/repo builds only; adding a page or section to an already-live site is a lighter path (see the cheat-sheet). New Phase 6.2 line: zone/domain hardening (Always Use HTTPS, HSTS, TLS min 1.2, Early Hints) added alongside the existing CDN-analytics step — found missing on a live-zone audit of a shipped site (free CDN plan, `always_use_https` off, no HSTS, TLS min 1.0). History: `references/CHANGELOG.md`.*

*v3.9 — new `phases/5-seo.md` §5.4 **AI-citation content must-haves**, split Tier A (gated) / Tier B (checklist) by evidence strength. Tier A comes from the only large controlled experiment in the field [Vishwakarma et al., SIGIR 2026, 252,000 counterbalanced trials, 6 LLMs, 18 factors]: **visible accurate date**, **explicit price/cost number**, **concrete named specifics** — each OR >>10,000 and unanimous across all six models, and all three were previously absent from this skill. Tier B holds the tactics that don't survive scrutiny but are free and good writing: numbers-first-60-words (no study has ever tested within-page placement; the three statistics benchmarks disagree in sign), data tables (kept on their ~+20% ORGANIC effect [SearchPilot] — as an AI-citation tactic, formatting measured OR 0.79–1.68, "no impact"), FAQ accordions, unhedged claims, self-contained sections, source attribution. Section opens with the counter-rule that governs it: body-only GEO rewrites *cut* post-rerank top-10 presence by 16% [SAGEO Arena], and every large measured citation effect is off-page. Includes a rejected-claims list naming three fabricated statistics in circulation. **Separately, by standing decision (not evidence): `FAQPage` un-banned, schema mandate 5 types → 6**, with schema-mirrors-visible-accordion as the enforceable constraint. History: `references/CHANGELOG.md`.*

*v3.8 — Markdown twins are now a Z1 crawler surface: every indexable page ships a `<route>.md` generated from the built HTML post-build, advertised by `<link rel="alternate" type="text/markdown">` and an `llms.txt` stanza (87–91% fewer bytes than the HTML, measured on two repos). Content negotiation on `Accept: text/markdown` is explicitly ruled OUT on this stack — it needs `run_worker_first: ["/*"]`, which bypasses the asset routing layer and silently turns every `_redirects` rule into a 200 (102 of them on one repo, caught with `wrangler dev`); the carve-out doesn't fit either, `run_worker_first` caps at 100 rules. Buy it from your CDN or skip it. Recipe + war story: `references/seo.md` → Markdown for agents. History: `references/CHANGELOG.md`.*

*v3.6 — new live-site health re-audit mode (`references/seo.md` § "Live-site health re-audit" + Phase 6.5): three runnable sitemap-wide scripts for dead schema, title↔H1 drift and locale-mirror 404s, on a monthly sweep from launch day. Triggered by an audit that found a live site breaking three rules THIS SKILL ALREADY CONTAINED — the gap was enforcement on shipped sites, not knowledge. Dead-schema rule hardened from "optional, skip it" to remove-if-present (+ `HowTo` added, + check content is visible before deleting a node); locale rules promoted out of the buried geo section into `references/core.md` with the sharper form (the switcher must READ the flag, not just have one); new rule that shared nav/footer/CTA components derive hrefs from the current locale; orphan check caveated as candidates-not-proof after 7 of 8 flagged URLs proved false positives. History: `references/CHANGELOG.md`.*

*v3.5 — evidence-based SEO/AI-SEO overhaul: `robots.txt` rules consolidated into `phases/5-seo.md` §5.2 (fixing a CCBot conflict between three separate copies of the UA list); `llms.txt` demoted from GATE 5 blocker to agent-tooling surface (Ahrefs n=137,210: 97% zero requests); schema mandate cut from ~9 types to 5 (FAQPage/Course rich results killed 2026; Mueller: "structured data won't make your site rank better"); `dateModified` reframed from "top AI-citation lever" to visible-date-only (claim was unsupported); new §5.3 crawler-delivery verification (staging + production) after first-party run data showed a live domain silently erroring to AI crawlers on over half its requests; titles/internal-linking/content-depth rules sharpened with controlled-experiment effect sizes; Phase 5/6 re-sequenced by file zone instead of blanket `[S]`, merging the old two-staging-deploy gate into one. History: `references/CHANGELOG.md`.*
